# Restaurant Management Software
- My buddy has started up a tiny business, a very small restaurant. He needs simple software to manage this business.
- Because of lacking finance and time, I simplified this project by following a project on the internet (Youtube).
- Fortunately, it's also working so fine!
- This software supports a Restaurant in ordering dishes, creating bills, payment and other administration.
- It's developed by C# + Winform + MS SQL Server.
#### Several technic are used in this Software:
- 3-layer Design Pattern (GUI - DAL - DTO) - be similar to MVC model
- Singleton Pattern

- Something here might helps you using Software:
	* The first, build your database by MS SQL Server:
		1. Open MS SQL Server Management Studio, create a New Query then Copy & Paste from Data.sql file.
		2. Edit your paths right.
